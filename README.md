# TraffIQ AI

This traffic simulation was built to explore how AI logic can improve traffic light decision-making based on real-time vehicle flow. I designed the system using JavaFX to visualize intersections and control signals dynamically. The AI logic adjusts timing based on simulated traffic conditions, and I implemented it to mimic responsive urban systems. Through this project, I practiced managing state machines, simulating event timing, and integrating real-time visuals with backend logic.
